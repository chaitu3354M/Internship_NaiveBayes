BREAST CANCER

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breast. It is one of the most common cancer affecting the women in worldwide, and in some rare cases, it can also affect men.

By using the data, need to predict wheather a given tumour is 'Malignant(cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous)' based the various features.

The dataset contains 30 features and 569 instances approx.

The features are

01. id -it represents the patient.

02. radius_mean: Mean of distances from center     to points on the perimeter of the tumor

03.texture_mean: Standard deviation of gray-scale values

04.perimeter_mean: Perimeter of the tumor

area_mean: Area of the tumor

05.smoothness_mean: Local variation in radius lengths

06.compactness_mean: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0

07.concavity_mean: Severity of concave portions of the contour

08.concave points_mean: Number of concave portions of the contour

09.symmetry_mean: Symmetry of the tumor

10.fractal_dimension_mean: "Coastline approximation" - 1

11.radius_se: Standard error of distances from center to points on the perimeter

12.texture_se: Standard error of gray-scale values

13.perimeter_se: Standard error of the tumor perimeter

14.area_se: Standard error of the tumor area

15.smoothness_se: Standard error of local variation in radius lengths

16.compactness_se: Standard error of perimeter^2 / area - 1.0

17.concavity_se: Standard error of severity of concave portions of the contour

18.concave points_se: Standard error for number of concave portions of the contour

19.symmetry_se: Standard error for symmetry of the tumor

20.fractal_dimension_se: Standard error for "coastline approximation" - 1

21.radius_worst: Worst mean value of distances from center to points on the perimeter

22.texture_worst: Worst mean value for standard deviation of gray-scale values

23.perimeter_worst: Worst mean value for tumor perimeter

24.area_worst: Worst mean value for tumor area

25.smoothness_worst: Worst mean value for local variation in radius lengths

26.compactness_worst: Worst mean value for perimeter^2 / area - 1.0

27.concavity_worst: Worst mean value for severity of concave portions of the contour

28.concave points_worst: Worst mean value for number of concave portions of the contour

29.symmetry_worst: Worst mean value for symmetry of the tumor

30.fractal_dimension_worst: Worst mean value for "coastline approximation" - 1

Importing Libraries and Load the Dataset 

- Pandas : It is used to manipulate and analysis the data.

â€Ž-Numpy : It is used for working with arrays and perform the mathematical operations.

-Matplotlib : It is used to visualise the data.

- Seaborn : It is used to visualise the data and exploring the relationships between variables.

###  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Command- .shape used to check the no.of rows and columns.
Command- .info() used to know the info of dataset.
Command- .describe() is used to describe the descriptive statistics.
Command- .isnull() is used to check the null value's.

### NULL VALUE IMPUTATION

Command- .fillna() is used to fill the null values if any present in the dataset by using the mean, median or mode.

VISUALISE THE DATA 

By using the different plot's used to visualise the data, plots are like Histogram, Barplot, Scatter plot, Box plot are used.

SPLIT THE DATA INTO TRAIN AND TEST

train_test_split - it is used to evaluate the model performance. It devide the dataset into two separate sets on the basis of percentage.

train_data- the train data is used to train the model to learn the underlying patterns and the relationships in the data.

test_data- the test data is used to evaluate the model performance on new unseen data.

MODEL BUILDING

Set the parameters of Naive bayes classifier

The model is based on Naive baye's formula

## Baye's Theorem##

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = Posterior probability
P(B|A) = Likeliihood Probability
P(A) = Prior Probability
P(B) = Probability of Event B

A. Compute the prior probability of each class in the training data.

Prior[c] = count(y_i = c) / n

B. Compute the conditional prabability of the features in each instances.


Cond_prob[j][c] = (count_jc + 1) / (count_c+2)

     count_jc = count(x_i[j] = 1 and y_i = c)
     count_c = count(y_i = c)

C. Compute the posterior probability of each class in given instances.

Post_prob[c] = prior[c] * (1- cond_prob[j][c])


select the class with highest posterior probability as the predicted class.

MODEL EVALUATION 

Predict the labels for the instances in test_data

## METRICS USED ###


Accuracy : Find the accuracy 
          Correct_predictions / total_predictions
F1 score:
          2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)
Recall:
        True positives / (true positives + false negatives)
Precision:
       True positives / (true positives + false positives)
